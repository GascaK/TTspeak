# TTspeak
Text to Speech and Speech Recognition header with Microsoft SAPI(5.4) use. Version 2.0

Background:
    The Microsoft Speech Aplication Program Interface (SAPI) is convoluted and contains little to no tutorials w/ documentation. So here's my attempt to shorten that learning curve, or make your code cleaner. Whatever comes first.

This is written in C++ (14) and the GCC and GNU library. Make sure to keep your
repositories up to date.

ttspeak.h is commented (//) with things that may help you understand the dynamics of
working with Microsoft's SAPI and its limitations.
